# Restart GHub quickly with fun effects

## Overview
Ghub keep glitching out everytime i restarted my PC so i had to kill it in Task Manager and that was annoying, but now it's fun

---

## How It Works

1. **Shuts down G Hub completely**
  
   The script kills `lghub.exe`, `lghub_agent.exe`, and `lghub_updater.exe` to ensure no processes are running.

4. **Play stupid sounds effects**
   
   May get extremely annoying after a few times.
   
5. **Restarts G Hub**
   
   Yeah that pretty much it.

6. **Wait for the interface to fully load**
   
   For 8 juicy seconds.

5. **Kill the program and put it in background**
   
   Because no one cares about GHub actually, i just want my G920 to work

7. **Thanks you for using it**
   
   What a good boy !

9. **Kill it self and the media player**
    
    So you don't have to do anything !
